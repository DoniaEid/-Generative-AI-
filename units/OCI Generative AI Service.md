## What is coher in LLMs?
 Coher is usually an abbreviation or term that refers to a model's ability to generate coherent and connected text across multiple sentences or paragraphs.

 This means the model maintains context and links ideas logically without going off-topic or providing contradictory information.

 The term is often used in LLM research to measure the quality of generated text in terms of internal coherence.

 In other words, the more “coher” a model is, the more natural, logical, and smooth the generated text appears.

##  What is an Embedding Model in AI?

An embedding model is a type of AI model that converts any data (text, image, audio, etc.) into a numerical representation called “vectors.”

The idea: each text or item is transformed into a set of numbers that represent its meaning or features in a way the computer can understand.

## Why do we use it?

  * Text search: Find documents similar to a specific word or query.

  * Text classification: Quickly determine the type or topic of a text.

  * Content recommendation: Like “similar products” or “songs you might like.”

  * Data comparison: Measure similarity between texts or items by calculating the distance between their vectors.
