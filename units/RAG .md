## LangChain Prompt 

   It is a structured text template that you give to the AI model to perform a specific task, with the ability to easily input different data, instead of writing all the instructions from scratch every time.

   * It is not an AI model itself.

   * It is not training for the model.

   * It is a smart way to organize commands and instructions for the model.

   * It allows you to reuse the same template with different data without rewriting everything.




## What is RAG(Retrieval-Augmented Generation) in AI?


Instead of the model relying only on the knowledge it was trained on, RAG allows it to search or retrieve information from external sources (like a database or documents) before generating an answer.


## Advantages of RAG:

   * Provides more accurate and up-to-date answers, because it doesn’t rely solely on the model’s pre-existing knowledge.

   * Very useful for specialized questions or rapidly changing information.

   * Allows combining retrieval and reasoning in a single step.
